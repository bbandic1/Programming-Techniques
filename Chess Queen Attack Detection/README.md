# Explanation of the Provided C++ Code

## Overview
This C++ program checks if queens on a chessboard are attacking each other. The program reads the chessboard configuration from the user, identifies the positions of the queens, and determines if any of the queens can attack each other based on the rules of chess.

## Functions

### `bool DaLiSeDameNapadaju(matrica m)`
This function checks if any queens on the chessboard are attacking each other.

**Parameters:**
- `matrica m`: A matrix representing the chessboard where `true` indicates the presence of a queen and `false` indicates an empty space.

**Functionality:**
1. Initializes three vectors to keep track of the rows, columns, and diagonals occupied by queens.
2. Iterates through each cell of the matrix.
3. If a queen is found, checks if any other queen is already in the same row, column, or diagonal.
4. If a conflict is found, returns `true`.
5. If no conflicts are found, returns `false`.

## `main` Function

**Functionality:**
1. Prompts the user to input the chessboard configuration.
2. Reads the input line by line, creating a matrix where each cell indicates whether it contains a queen.
3. Calls the `DaLiSeDameNapadaju` function to check if the queens are attacking each other.
4. Outputs the result to the user.
