## Explanation of the Provided C Code

This C code analyzes a square matrix entered by the user to determine its type: null matrix, identity matrix, diagonal matrix, upper triangular matrix, lower triangular matrix, or secondary diagonal matrix.

### Variables and Arrays

- **Variables**:
  - `n`: User-input integer representing the size of the square matrix (`n x n`).
  - `mat[1000][1000]`: 2D array to store the matrix elements.
  - Various flags (`null_matrica`, `jed_matrica`, `dijagonalna_matrica`, `gornja_trougaona`, `donja_trougaona`, `sporedna_dijagonala`) to indicate the type of matrix based on certain conditions.

### Input Validation and Matrix Input

- **Input Loop**:
  - Prompts the user to enter the size `n` of the matrix until a valid size within the range of 1 to 100 is provided.
  - Prompts the user to enter the elements of the matrix using nested loops.

### Matrix Type Identification

- **Null Matrix**:
  - Checks if all elements of the matrix are zero.

- **Identity Matrix**:
  - Checks if all diagonal elements (where `i == j`) are `1` and all other elements are `0`.

- **Diagonal Matrix**:
  - Checks if both upper and lower triangular conditions are satisfied simultaneously.

- **Upper Triangular Matrix**:
  - Checks if all elements below the main diagonal (`i > j`) are `0`.

- **Lower Triangular Matrix**:
  - Checks if all elements above the main diagonal (`j > i`) are `0`.

- **Secondary Diagonal Matrix**:
  - Checks if all elements outside the secondary diagonal (`i + j != n - 1`) are `0`.

### Output

- **Printing Matrix Type**:
  - Prints the type of matrix based on the first satisfied condition:
    - Null Matrix, Identity Matrix, Diagonal Matrix, Upper Triangular Matrix, Lower Triangular Matrix, or Secondary Diagonal Matrix.
  - If none of the conditions are satisfied, prints "Nista od navedenog" (None of the above).

### Conclusion

This program effectively categorizes a square matrix based on predefined conditions for various types such as null, identity, diagonal, upper triangular, lower triangular, and secondary diagonal matrices. It demonstrates the use of nested loops and conditional statements to analyze and classify matrix properties.
