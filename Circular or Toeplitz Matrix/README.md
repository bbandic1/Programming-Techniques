## Explanation of the Provided C Code

The provided C code determines the characteristics of a matrix based on user input and criteria defined within the program.

### Constants and Variables

- **Constants**:
  - `EPSILON`: Defined as `0.0001`, used for comparing floating-point numbers for equality.

- **Variables**:
  - `matrix[100][100]`: Array to store the user-defined matrix elements.
  - `m`, `n`: Variables to store the dimensions of the matrix.
  - `i`, `j`: Loop counters.
  - `brj1`, `brj2`, `brj_el`: Counters to track specific conditions in the matrix.

### User Input and Matrix Initialization

The program first prompts the user to input dimensions `m` and `n` for the matrix, ensuring they are within the range of 1 to 100. Then, it prompts for the matrix elements which are stored in the `matrix` array.

### Matrix Analysis

1. **Checking Teplicova Condition (`brj1`)**:
   - Iterates through the matrix and counts pairs of adjacent elements (`matrix[i][j]` and `matrix[i+1][j+1]`) that are within `EPSILON` tolerance of each other.

2. **Checking Circular Matrix Condition (`brj2`)**:
   - Counts pairs of elements (`matrix[i][j]` and `matrix[i+1][j+1]`, and wrapping around from the last column of a row to the first column of the next row) that satisfy the `EPSILON` tolerance condition.

3. **Matrix Classification**:
   - Determines if the matrix meets criteria for being Teplicova (all adjacent elements similar) or circular (specific pattern of similarity across wrapping boundaries), or neither.

### Output

Based on the analysis:
- Prints "Matrica je Teplicova" if the matrix meets the Teplicova condition.
- Prints "Matrica je cirkularna" if the matrix meets the circular condition.
- Prints "Matrica nije ni cirkularna ni Teplicova" if it meets neither condition.

### Conclusion

This program provides a structured approach to analyze a matrix based on predefined mathematical criteria, illustrating practical use of loops, conditionals, and floating-point comparisons in C programming.
