## Explanation of the Provided C Code

This C code reads a matrix from user input, computes its transpose, and prints the transposed matrix.

### Variables and Arrays

- **Variables**:
  - `mat[100][100]`: 2D array to store the matrix elements.
  - `V`, `S`: Variables to store the height (rows) and width (columns) of the matrix.
  - `i`, `j`: Loop counters used throughout the program.
  - `nesto`: Temporary variable used for swapping elements during matrix transposition.

### Input Validation

- **Input Loop**:
  - Prompts the user to enter the dimensions (height and width) of the matrix (`V` and `S`).
  - Ensures that both dimensions are within the range of 1 to 100. If not, prompts the user to enter correct dimensions.

### Matrix Input

- **Matrix Elements**:
  - Prompts the user to enter the elements of the matrix.
  - Uses nested loops to read and store each element in the `mat` array.

### Matrix Transposition

- **Transposition Logic**:
  - Checks if the width `S` is greater than the height `V`.
    - If true (`S > V`), transposes the matrix by swapping elements across the main diagonal (i > j).
    - If false (`V >= S`), transposes the matrix similarly (i > j), ensuring correct handling of dimensions.

### Output

- **Printing the Transposed Matrix**:
  - Prints the transposed matrix in a formatted manner:
    - Iterates through the transposed matrix (`mat`), printing each element aligned in columns.

### Conclusion

This program demonstrates the basic operations of reading a matrix from user input, computing its transpose based on the defined conditions (`S > V` or `V >= S`), and printing the resulting transposed matrix. It illustrates the use of nested loops and conditional statements in handling matrix operations.
