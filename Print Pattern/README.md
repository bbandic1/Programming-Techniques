## Explanation of the Provided C Code

This C code defines functions to create and print a rectangular pattern using ASCII characters based on user input.

### Function: `crtanje`

- **Parameters**:
  - `niz[]`: Array containing alternating values of characters and their respective counts.
  - `vel`: Size of the array `niz[]`.

- **Purpose**:
  - Iterates through the array `niz[]`, where each element represents a character and its repetition count.
  - Prints each character the specified number of times.

### Function: `pravougaonik`

- **Parameters**:
  - `a`: Width of the rectangle (number of characters in each row).
  - `b`: Height of the rectangle (number of rows).
  - `znak`: ASCII value of the character used to draw the rectangle.

- **Variables**:
  - `niz[1000]`: Array to store the pattern configuration.
  - `v`, `i`, `j`, `z`: Various counters and indices used in constructing the pattern.

- **Purpose**:
  - Constructs different patterns based on the values of `a` and `b`:
    - If `a == 1` and `b == 1`, prints a single character.
    - If `a < 3`, prints a pattern where each row consists of the character repeated `a` times.
    - Otherwise, prints a rectangle pattern:
      - Top and bottom rows are filled with the character `znak`, repeated `a` times.
      - Middle rows (if `b` is even) alternate between the character `znak` at the beginning and end, separated by spaces, with a central gap.
      - Middle rows (if `b` is odd) are similar but without a central gap.

### `main` Function

- **Input**:
  - Prompts the user to enter values for `a` (width) and `b` (height) of the rectangle.
  - Reads these values using `scanf`.

- **Execution**:
  - Calls the `pravougaonik` function with user-provided values for `a`, `b`, and a predefined value `z=42` (ASCII code for '*').

- **Output**:
  - Based on user input, generates and prints the corresponding rectangle pattern using the specified character.

### Conclusion

This program demonstrates the use of arrays, loops, and conditionals to generate and print various ASCII art patterns based on user input dimensions. It provides flexibility in pattern generation depending on the input values `a` and `b`.
