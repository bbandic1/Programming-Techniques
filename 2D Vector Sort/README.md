# Explanation of the Provided C++ Code

## Overview
This C++ program sorts a 2D vector (matrix) based on the sum of the elements in each row. It reads the matrix elements from the user, sorts the rows in descending order of their sums, and prints the sorted matrix.

## Functions

### `template <typename tip> bool Kriterij (tip a, tip b)`
This function compares two rows of the matrix based on the sum of their elements.

**Parameters:**
- `tip a`: The first row.
- `tip b`: The second row.

**Functionality:**
1. Calculates the sum of elements in row `a`.
2. Calculates the sum of elements in row `b`.
3. Returns `true` if the sum of `a` is greater than the sum of `b`.

### `template <typename tip> void SortirajPoSumiRedova(std::vector<std::vector<tip>> &v)`
This function sorts the rows of the matrix in descending order based on the sum of their elements.

**Parameters:**
- `std::vector<std::vector<tip>> &v`: The matrix to be sorted.

**Functionality:**
1. Checks if the matrix is empty. If it is, it does nothing.
2. Uses the `std::sort` function with `Kriterij` to sort the rows of the matrix.

## `main` Function

**Functionality:**
1. Declares a 2D vector to store the matrix.
2. Prompts the user to input the elements of the matrix, with `*` indicating the end of a row and `*` at the beginning of a row indicating the end of input.
3. Reads the elements of the matrix from the user.
4. Calls the `SortirajPoSumiRedova` function to sort the rows of the matrix.
5. Prints the sorted matrix.
