## Explanation of the Provided C Code

The provided C code defines a function `zadatak2` that processes a given input string to find and output the word with the maximum number of identical characters, irrespective of case. The `main` function serves as an entry point to the program, printing a simple message.

### Function: `zadatak2`

The `zadatak2` function takes two arguments:
- `char *ulaz`: A pointer to the input string.
- `char *izlaz`: A pointer to the output string where the result will be stored.

#### Steps of `zadatak2`:

1. **Initialization**:
    - Pointers for processing the input string and tracking words are initialized.
    - Variables for tracking the maximum repetition count and initialization status are set.

2. **Word Processing**:
    - The function iterates through the input string to identify words (sequences of alphabetic characters).
    - For each word, it checks each character's frequency within the word (case-insensitive).
    - If a word with a higher or equal repetition count is found, it updates the maximum repetition count and stores the starting pointer of this word.

3. **Result Output**:
    - After processing the entire input string, if a word with the maximum repetition count was found, it copies this word to the output string.
    - The output string is null-terminated.
